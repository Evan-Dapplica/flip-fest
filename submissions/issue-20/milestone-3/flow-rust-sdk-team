##  Flow-Rust-SDK - Milestone 1, 2, 3

This PR is for issue #20.

### Current Status
The Flow-Rust-SDK is feature complete, meaning that as a user you can accomplish any task you need to do.
There is still a good amount of work to be done on the documentation of how to accomplish common tasks.
All user tasks are abstracted away from the gRPC API layer, meaning that (for most things) you don't have
to deal with complex RLP encoding yourself.

- [Version 1.0.x released on Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/flow-rust-sdk).
- [Documentation on SDK utilization is under way](https://docs.rs/flow-rust-sdk/latest/flow_rust_sdk)


Blocks:

- [x] retrieve a block by ID
- [x] retrieve a block by height
- [x] retrieve the latest block


Collections:

- [x] retrieve a collection by ID


Events:

- [x] retrieve events by name in the block height range


Scripts:

- [x] submit a script and parse the response
- [x] submit a script with arguments and parse the response


Accounts:

- [x] retrieve an account by address
- [x] create a new account
- [x] deploy a new contract to the account
- [x] remove a contract from the account
- [x] update an existing contract on the account


Transactions:

- [x] retrieve a transaction by ID
- [x] sign a transaction (single payer, proposer, authorizer or combination of multiple)
- [x] submit a signed transaction
- [x] sign a transaction with arguments and submit it



### Milestones
- 1 [x] Implement the gRPC layer of the SDK, allowing communication with the Flow blockchain
- 2 [x] Accomplish transaction signing in a way that handles the complex algorithm / hashing / encoding for the user.
- 3 [x] Meet and exceed Flow SDK guidelines
- 4 [ ] Complete documentation and common usage examples are available
